# Basic Setup

- we need 2 directories in the the project, one being the dist folder and the other being the src folder
- dist is the folder which goes into production, like the tailwind code that we've written builds some CSS files accordingly

- command to tailwindconfig.js files => npx tailwindcss init

- the input.css file in src folder has these 3 lines (@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;)
