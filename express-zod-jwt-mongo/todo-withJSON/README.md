## Todo App

[files from "files" directory are kind of acting like a database, "App" directory contains the todo app's server,"node modules" directory contains libraries and other testing libraries from assignment which I'll use in future to write tests for the code]

In this repo, I've listed down my todo app's backend which consists of these features :-

- backend is built in javascript using node.js and express.js library
- global catches and several try-catch blocks for security
- I've included zod library for input validation
- I'm using jwt bearer token for authentication using middleware functions

#### Thank for reading this readme file
