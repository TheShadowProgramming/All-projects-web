// rafce is shortcut to make a react component where we're importing react and then exporting the component too
// it's better to make a components folder in the src folder where we'll write code for every component, and seperate styling for every component
// react bootstrap if the framework to bootstrap your react project, react bootstrap se components utha rahe to
// className keyword
// ye bhadwa windows me case insesitivity hai bc, matlab windows considers capital letter file same as small letter file
// use react bootstrap only for styling react components since react bootstrap under the hood uses virtual DOM and the actual DOM
// react snippets extension for rfce and other shortcut keys, control + space for some component that we haven't imported yet
// that will automatically write the import statement for that component
// react bootstrap se components import karo, fir individual component files ke css files se style karo

// NOTES FROM PARAM-REACT PROJECT :-

// start with installing react-bootstrap using the command in docs
// then include the cdn link tag od font-awesome and google fonts if you want, also include the reactBootstrap css link tag
// search the docs for the components that you like and then use the import statements from the top of the docs
// check each component for specific learning
// the # tags that are included in the hrefs of different navbar.link components will redirect user to the element with that id
// and in this way the page becomes a single page application

// useEffect hook introduction :-

// useEffect hook is used to run some code after a certain side effect in the website
// like if state changes then useEffect hook will run, like if the page renders then the useEffect hook works
// it takes 2 arguments, one being the callback function inside which the code is present
// which is supposed to run after our desired side Effect happens
// and the second argument describes when the useEffect would come into action
// it must be an array of dependencies(basically variables) which when changed, useEffect hook starts working
// if the 2nd argument is an empty array then the useEffect hook only run the code when the page re-renders

// window object and eventListener :- window object has some useful attributes like
// scrollY (amount of pixels travelled from the top of the page to the current window's top)
// window.innerHeight gives the height of the current window open
// window.addEventListener is used to listen to events happening in the window
// addEventListener accepts 2 arguments, one being the event like scroll or resize, and the other being the callback function which runs when the event happens
// we can also use the removeEventListener to remove the event listener, to avoid memory leaks which uses more resources than desired
// usually we remove eventListener when the component is unmounted (removed from the dom)
// in the context of useEffect, we return a function which will be called when the component unmounts, and inside that function is the code which will remove the event listener
//

// React Bootstrap and other CSS hacks :-
// if we want ki parent element ka background dikhai de, then we gotta use these properties variant=light, bg=transparent, fixed=top, expand=lg in the reactBootstrap component that we're using
// display: grid, place-items: center, place-content: center se website me jo bhi hoga vo ekdum proper center me aa jaayega
// freefrontend website to use the many html css and js snippets to make our frontend work speak up
