# Merge conflicts

- what I like to do is to pull the changes first and then push the changes to the origin repo
- when if there are conflicts the pulling changes then fetch the changes in remote branch which would be named something like origin/main
- and then merge those changes in the local repo using conflict management system of vs code which gives you like option to add the stuff that you want and delete the stuff that you want 
- and fir agar push karne me conflicts hai to fir commit the changes in a seperate branch itself and then merge those changes accordingly into your main branch or master branch

# Name errors

- if your local branch has different name than your remote repo then your push will face some problems 
- so either rename your branch or push the code into some other branch and then merge the code there
